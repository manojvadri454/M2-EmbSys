# Smart Water Tap

## Abstract 
Water is one of the most important and irreplaceable natural resources on the planet. It must be handled with care and efficiency in order to be preserved forfuture generations. Water is one of the most vital elements for life on Earth. Water circulates through the soil in the same way it circulates through the body, carrying and dissolving nutrients and organic matter and replenishing them. There are a couple of electronic flow measurement devices on the market that are supported by hardware sensors, but no software applications have been produced. Water management can be a sensitive problem that needs to be treated with extreme caution. This project is concerned with the automated and effective control of water. The aim of this model is to regulate the flow of water according to predetermined parameters.This project's primary goal is to create a flow control system.

The main goal of this project is to reduce water waste and provide a healthy and independent living environment for the elderly handicapped, and patients by incorporating tap automation into the smart homes.
