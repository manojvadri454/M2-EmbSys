# Smart Dust Bin

## Abstract 
Smart Dust Bin as its names to depict. It works likewise smart things. It is a decent gadget to make your home clean. due to practically all offspring of home consistently make it grimy and spread trash to a great extent by paper, rappers and numerous different things. since the smart dustbin is additionally intriguing and kids make fun with it so they help to keep clean your home. they generally will be utilized to through all trash and waste into this smart dustbin.smart dustbin opens and closes it’s top when somebody is before it. when you come before it. it’s top get open. also, when you toss the loss into it then it closes independent from anyone else. so how it’s work what the standard behind it and what the segments and sensors do it conceivable.

# Components

1. Arduino UNO  - Arduino UNO is a low-cost, flexible, and easy-to-use programmable open-source microcontroller board that can be integrated into a variety of electronic projects.

2. Ultrasonic Sensor - An ultrasonic sensor is an instrument that measures the distance to an object using ultrasonic sound waves. An ultrasonic sensor uses a transducer to send and receive ultrasonic pulses that relay back information about an object's proximity.

3. IR sensor - An infrared sensor (IR sensor) is a radiation-sensitive optoelectronic component with a spectral sensitivity in the infrared wavelength.IR sensors are now widely used in motion detectors, which are used in building services to switch on lamps or in alarm systems to detect unwelcome guests.

4. Servo motor - A servomotor is a rotary actuator or linear actuator that allows for precise control of angular or linear position, velocity and acceleration. It consists of a suitable motor coupled to a sensor for position feedback.

5. LED - (light-emitting diode) a semiconductor diode that emits light when conducting current and is used in electronic displays, indoor and outdoor lighting.
